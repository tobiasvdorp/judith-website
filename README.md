# Website Judith

## Overview

This project is an ongoing effort to create a modern, high-performance website using Next.js and TailwindCSS. The site leverages the Builder.io visual CMS to ensure that my client can easily maintain and update the content.

## Key Features

- **Next.js**: Utilized for its powerful features like static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring optimal performance and SEO.
- **TailwindCSS**: Implemented for rapid UI development and a great developer experience.
- **Builder.io**: Integrated as the visual CMS to provide an intuitive interface for content management, enabling the client to make updates effortlessly.

## Goals

One of my primary objectives is to deliver a lightning-fast, SEO-optimized website. I am committed to achieving a 100% score on all Lighthouse metrics for every page. To ensure this, I am continuously testing the website using [Unlighthouse](https://unlighthouse.dev/).
